This is not the best implementation possible, but I think it's pretty straightforward and demonstrates well the expressiveness of ruby.

### Optional Dependencies: ###

```ruby-terminfo``` if you want your terminal width autodetected.
```gosu``` if you want to use the gui 
```RubyInline``` if you want the fast C inner loop
